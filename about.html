    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>My objective is to move beyond just learning <b>code and hardware</b> to truly understanding how technology 
        can make life easier and more efficient for people. I’m focused on building a solid technical foundation while sharpening 
        my ability to solve frustrating problems with patience and a bit of creativity. My ultimate goal is to become the kind of 
        professional who not only manages complex systems but also communicates them in a way that feels accessible and helpful to everyone.</p>
